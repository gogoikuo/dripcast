Dripcast
========

Dripcast is a Java programming framework for large scale IoT applications.
The Dripcast is desinged and implemented for IoT applications
to work with computer resources on various cloud platforms, transparently.

Key benefits of the Dripcast
----------------------------

1) providing transparent framework, that is
 very simple and easy programming framework with
 original transparent remote procedure call mechanism.
 There is no need for IoT application programmers
 to take care of server side programming nor backend database.
 IoT application may store or process data on cloud platform
 via the transparent framework, without writing server-side code.
 Only what programmers have to do is implement application logic.
 Thus, the Dripcast is called "server-less progamming framework."

2) working with highly scalable architecture.
 The framework has a scalable computing resources on cloud envinroment.
 The architecture is fully distributed and there is no centralized server
 nor relational database.
 There are a large scale data store (like, AWS-S3, Azure-blob, etc.) and
 DHT based distributed processing engines for processing data.
 There is no single point of failure (NO SPoF) nor bottleneck.

Repositories
------------

* alpha is the initial alpha release.

* beta is the second release, for proof of concept (will be available, in a near future)
